        <h1 class="text">   Background of the Company<br>
          <br>The "Toy Alley" Company was established by 2JMNK Co. in 2022. Throughout its history, 
          Toy Alley has brought happiness, comfort, and creativity to clients in a range of industries. The five 
          friends who made the decision to go it alone and create their own business, M*******, K******, J*******, J******, and N******* are 
          the ones who gave Toy Alley its start in the big industry. The first item sold by Toy Alley was a 
          "Turumpo," a well-known Filipino toy that was popular in the 1980s with both kids and adults. A common 
          iron nail is affixed to the bottom of a turumpo, an outdoor toy that is formed like a mixture of a 
          half-sphere on top and a conical part. Turumpos are typically made of hardwoods like "bayabas," "ipil," 
          or "sampaloc," but some varieties are also made of plastic or metal. "Tyate," an 80 to 100 cm thread that 
          must be spun from the nail tip to the half of the wooden body before being thrown on the flat ground, is 
          used to control the game of turumpo. One end of the "tyate" has a single knot, while the other end has a 
          knot with a "tansan" (cover for glass soft drink bottles). The sale of Turumpo sky rocketed and it made 
          Toy Alley in its place right now.</h1>

          <br>The purpose of the company is to provide joy, comfort, and a boost to one's creativity through playing with toys that we manufacture in-house. 
          One's joy is as important to our company as the comfort of the people, especially the comfort of knowing that our toys are all safe for all living species.
          Making sure our toys are safe is also one of our primary goals in winning our customers' or clients' confidence and developing relationships with them. 
          Our customers/clients and employees are the ones who have brought our company to where it is now. On the other hand, the company's mission is to open 
          additional branches throughout the world so that more people may play with our products. We envisage our company continuing to produce and spread love 
          and joy in the future by manufacturing toys that you may collect, play with, gift to loved ones, children, and sell.
